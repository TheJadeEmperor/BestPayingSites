<p align="justify">Neobux is without a doubt one of the most profitable PTC Programs on the web. They have been established since 2008, and they have not stopped changing and evolving since then. Most PTC users have either heard of Neobux or are already members.
As of this year, they have over 20 Million members and they're still growing their network. They have paid over <span class="highlight">$80 Million</span> in cashouts, and this proves without a doubt that they are a legit, paying company.

They have various new features, such as <span class="highlight">getting paid to do tasks and offers</span>, as well as the ability to make <span class="highlight">commissions</span> when one of your downline completes an offer. </p>
