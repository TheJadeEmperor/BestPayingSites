<p>"I make $1200 in Neobux, and that's just the beginning. None of this would be possible without Neobux"
-Ledo


"I will start my story from the end. I 'm in position to say that I make around $2500 per month thanks to neobux. This is calculated after I have deducted all the expenses (renewals and recycle). As you understand $2500 is a real pure profit while my capital is safe and continues to yield every month (yes the capital is my fellow rented referrals).
I really don't know the most proper words to express the feelings of success. As we all know there are millions if not billions of individuals that they are making a living with way less than $2500 per month and I respect these people very much. The above fact alone does it for me even more difficult to describe how really wonderful is, when an internet project gives you such a great opportunity to earn real money without a painful work and most of all without a boss. I like independency, I think everyone does."
