<p>Dear visitor, </p>

<p>As you know, paid to click sites are full of scams and liars. Unfortunately many people fall for these scams because they lure you in with the money and use your greed against you. That's why I have come up with a method to determine if a PTC is worth investing in or not. 
</p>

<p>If you want to find out if a site is a scam or not, I recommend you follow my process to determine a site's worth, before putting any time or money into it.  </p> 

<h2>** Step 1 **</h2>

<p>Do a Google search to see what results come up. Do something like "[PTC Site] review" and read about other people's experiences with the site. </p>

<p>If a lot of people say it's a scam, chances are it's a scam. You must DYOR - do your own research before joining a site that is new and untrusted. It also helps to search for Payment Proofs from that PTC Site like "[PTC Site] Payment proof".</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>** Step 2 **</h2>
<p>Here are some websites that review PTC sites: </p>

<p><a target="_BLANK" href="">https://www.sitejabber.com/ </a></p>

<p><a target="_BLANK" href="">https://www.beermoneyforum.com/ </a></p>

<p>These review sites have been known to be trustworthy and helpful. See if your site is on the scam list.</p> 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>** Step 3 **</h2>
<p>Do a whois search. </p>

<p>Go here and type in the domain name:<br /> 
<a target="_BLANK" href="">https://www.whois.net/ </a></p>

<p>The whois search will give you some useful info about a particular site. Look for the Expiration Date, that is the date the domain will expire. In other words, it's the day the website will disappear. 
</p>

<p>I do not want to get into detail about domains, it is beyond the scope of this conversation. Just know that most likely the owner will not renew the website. Often times, a site will became a scam near the Expiration Date. If this date is close by, then proceed with caution. </p>

<p>Hope this helps you.</p>
