<p><b>Do a Google search </b> - Most of you probably know this, but just in case...USE GOOGLE. It is excellent at capturing these sites and info about a possible scam. I would suggest your search term should have the site's name with the term SCAM.</p>

<p>Example: Onbux Scam</p>

<p>When you do these kind of searches it will show you every site, forum, and blog that will tell you whether or not a site is a scam. Remember, most current members will talk about these sites especially on forums. Also if you click a link and the site is no longer up, try the "cache". Sometimes google will have the info and the site in the google cache.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Look over the site</b> - What I mean by that is, test the links on the site. Are they working? If you click on a link that says "contact us" is it functional? Does the "contact us" page load? Usually if a site has more than one dead link, it can mean a sign of trouble. Either the owner has abandon the site and is just leaving it up to see if it will come back to life. Or the site is just made to look more than what is seems. Some owners will close a site down and have a new web address and new site up within days. So make sure the site is operational.</p>

<p>A big clue to see if a site is the real deal, look for a FORUM link. If a site has a forum, it is a good sign that the owner is the real deal. If you sign up and the forum is taken down, then that is also a sign that the owner is about to bail or payments are not being made.
</p>

<p>Being able to communicate with the site and it's staff should be available to you. Some sites will have a Forum, a Live Chat, a phone number, email addresses, and a mailing address. If you don't see any of these things, it can mean the owner is hiding and is only in it to make money. Which means he will make what he can and run when it start failing.</p>

<p>And also...READ THE TERMS OF SERVICE!! So many of us are guilty of not reading the TOS. I know, it can be boring as hell! But that is the point of  the TOS. Watch out for the wordage. And take a screen shot of the TOS on the day you sign up. You never know when it might be needed later down the road.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Referrals/Packages</b> - Some sites will offer to give you referrals for a fee. Meaning they will give you unreferred members and you can earn off of their clicks. Some of these ref packs come in a set of 15, 25, 100, 500 members. Nine times out of Ten, they are bots. Sorry to say, but that is the ugly truth. Bots are fake members who click, and the clicks tend to die all at once. Most PTC sites will have bots, and most PTC owners will deny it.</p>

<p>Sites like Neobux will rent out refs. Meaning for a period of time you can earn off of a certain member, but you must pay a monthly fee. Whether they are bot or not is debatable Some members say they are.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Investing</b> - Do not invest until you have received your first payout. Unless you don't mind losing your money. And never invest more than what you can afford to lose. Some people will go crazy and invest big money into PTC sites. At the time, they could afford it, but later down the road, thy wished they didn't and desperately need the money back. Don't end up like these people.</p>

<p>PTC sites can change within a blink of an eye. A site that was once paying can quickly become a site that is not paying. Look for these signs by reading the forum and do frequent google searches to find the signs of a failing PTC site. You start seeing these signs? Get your money out of that site and get away from that site as fast as you can!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Cashing Out</b> - The whole reason why we are there. Right? When it comes time to cash out or if you reached your minimum limit, Cash out. Don't wait, do it as soon as possible. Like I said things can change and fast. Some sites have instant payments, or some pay on a certain day of the month. Like Fusion Cash pays on the 20th of every month. Or some, pay 30 business days. If a site does not pay you within the terms you agreed upon when you first signed up, then STOP INVESTING. Do not give another nickle to that site.</p>

<p>However you should try to keep your account active. Most sites will allow you to stay active as long as you log in within 30 days and view one ad. Make sure you do that, or the owner will have a reason to delete your account and not pay you. Which they love to do. Cause to them that is one less account that they have to pay. Each site is different, be sure to find out if your account can go inactive and how to keep it active.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p><b>If you are not being paid</b> - start gathering info. Be sure to save your receipts and credit card transactions. Take screenshots, of the site, the forum, your account, everything and anything to do with that site. Get screenshots of the staff on forums. Most of the time the owner will be a staff member. And usually the one that takes most offense when someone says the word "scam". Be sure to submit a ticket and demand answers. If you get a blanket reply, and it looks like they are not concerned about it, start taking action. Start contacting law agencies and other web sites. Here are some places where you can file a complaint.</p>

<p>Some PTC sites will pay a member if they threaten to report them. That is if a owner is concerned about their reputation.</p>
