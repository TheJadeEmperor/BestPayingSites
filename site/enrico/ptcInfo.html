<h1>PTC Informations</h1>

<p>Paid To Click is an online business niche that delivers online traffic to several campaigns, banners and other programs with one big goal...WINNING CUSTOMERS and SALES!
Paid-To-Click, or simply PTC websites, acting as middlemen between advertisers and consumers; the advertiser pays for his campaign (ads, banners, text-links and much more) on the PTC website, and a part of this payment goes to the viewer when he views the advertisement.</p>

<p>Even though advertisements are the most widely known method for PTC sites to stay alive, much of the profit is generated or produced due direct sales of referrals or purchased upgrade packages which are created by the owner of each PTC site. This has led to the proliferation of online scam or ponzi schemes being created with PTC sites as a cover, as members are encouraged to buy referrals that are not actually human or upgrade packages that offer no real value. As well, some sites[who?] may request that their users pay an "upgrade fee" before being able to cash out their earnings, and then not paying out earnings after these fees are paid.
Scams, although exposed on various PTC forums, are still heavily used by newcomers who are drawn into the websites by search engines. Scam PTC sites are known to attract new users with cheap offers for upgrades and referrals and disappear without trace after a short time.
