               Ask yourself, "Do I really want to do the work of getting direct referrals?"  Some people
         quit before they start. Other find it tedious and cannot stick it out till they actually earn. But,
         some stay in it and DO get the Referrals and make a steady income.  Is that you?

         You need a marketing strategy.  To get referrals you need a website, you need an offer and/or a product, 
         you need a capture page, you need an email service provider, you need an autoresponder, and, most importantly, 
         you need an AD. All these things together help get you traffic.
