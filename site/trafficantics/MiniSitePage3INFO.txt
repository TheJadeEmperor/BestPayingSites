      Clixsense recently refocused their members to earning from their Affiliate Programs and Surveys,rather than clicking ads.
Clixsense tasks are time consuming, however you can earn more from it than viewing ads. Clixsense is the only program in the PTC 
world that will give you an opportunity to earn serious income. You won’t make money from it easily since it’s a commission based 
program, but it’s the real deal if you want to have a long term steady income online. If you refer someone in ClixSense and 
upgraded their membership ($17), you will automatically get a $2 commision. And if this person refers another person  
and they upgrade membership, you will get another $1. This process continues up to 8 tiers referrals Fantastic! 
Basically, you will get $2 from your direct referral and $1 for tiers 2 thru 8 referral upgrades.

BuxP pays it's membership (more than 7 years) and has a very nice affiliate program. They offer viewing ads, but also have videos 
which you can view for cash or credits. BuxP has tasks where you can earn $0.01 – $0.10 for doing a very simple tasks like 
downloading their toolbar, installing the Alexa toolbar, liking a Facebook page, and signing up to other PTC sites. It’s very 
easy to do and the earnings are above average. Cash just seems to add up at BuxP if you click daily and follow their available 
resources.

Scarlet-Clicks came along about 7 years ago, and I joined. It's one of those PTC's that you just keep clicking each day, earning
each day, and being a part of youor portfolio. You can collect after $2.00, get your money or put it back in adding direct 
referrals. You can click and get points, earn cash, perform the clix grid, do simple tasks, like the PTC Wall, or surveys.
It is a nice supplemental program to have in your portfolio of paying sites.
