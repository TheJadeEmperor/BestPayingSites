<h2>What is a PTC Site?</h2>

<p>PTC sites are called as Paid To Click sites. As the name implies, you are getting paid to click and watch ads in your browser. 
</p>

<p>You should join a PTC because it's free to join. It takes 3-5 minutes daily to work in one PTC Site. If you do it right, you can earn $250-$500 a month from PTC Sites. Not only is it free, but it does not require any special skills, only basic computer skills are needed, and you can earn this money working from home. </p> 

<p>All you need are the following:</p>

<p>
<ul>
	<li>A personal computer with an internet connection</li>
	<li>A gmail account</li>
	<li>A Paypal or Payza Account</li>
	<li>A personal bank account</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h2>How Much is Too Much?</h2>

<p>Is there such a thing as too many PTCs? Have a headache managing all these accounts? Chances are, if you have more than 10 PTC / GPT sites, you are doing too much. A good balance is 5 to 10 sites. We are all tempted, at one point or another, to join as many sites as possible, hoping to make a lot of money. But realistically, it is too much for one person to handle.</p>

<p>Several people have told me that at any given point, they have 20 to 30 PTC's that they surf daily. That is insane if you think about it! You're supposed to diversify, but this is not the way. Think about it, you have to have 20 different accounts, which means 20 usernames and passwords to memorize and keep track of. Also, you have to keep track of 20 different sets of referrals. Every PTC is different has their own rules and special features, which you also have to memorize.</p>

<p>And on top of that, you have click for hours every day just to earn a little bit of money. Having 5 to 10 sites that you use daily is the optimum number, any more than that is overload. You may have to "weed out" the lower quality websites and keep only the best ones. It is a tough decision, but we all have to do it. How many PTC's you use is completely up to you. If you can handle more than 10 and are making a lot of money from each one then congratulations, because you are succeeding. But that is usually the exception not the rule.</p>


<h2>How to Avoid Scams</h2>

<p>The scam rate for bux sites is high - it feels as if everyday, a bux site becomes a scam, and in the same day, another bux site is born. In this field, you need to take certain measures to protect yourself from being scammed. The good news is that when a site is becoming a scam, there are certain tell-tale signs that indicate as such. Usually these signs are pretty obvious, so we will list them out for you.</p>

<p>Signs of abandonment. If the admin does not answer questions on the forum, or if there are broken links or errors on the site, and they are not being fixed, these are signs of abandonment. Maybe the admin has given up on the site, so watch out for these signs.</p>


<p>Many complaints. If a site has many complaints against it, pay close attention, because the users are not happy. Use google to find out more information - we suggest typing the site's name followed by the word scam. For example, try "onbux scam" - you'll never know if the results are what you expected.</p>

<p>Being picky with payments. If a site pays certain members, but does not pay others, that is a big red flag. It probably means they are running out of money, so they can only pay a small amount of members. Many bux sites rely on ads and upgrades for funds, and if the funds run out, then they will not be able to pay its members. If you have a pending cash out and have not received your payment yet, then send a support ticket and see what happens. Hopefully they are just having delays - but always expect the worst case scenario.</p>

<p>Problems with Paypal & Payza. The whole point of joining a new site is to cash out, right? Then what if you can't, because the site is having problems with Papyal or Alertpay? If that happens, that is a red flag, an indication that the site is going downhill.</p>
