<h1>How it Works</h1>

<h3><span class="highlightGray">Phase 1</span></h3>

<p>Start clicking ads everyday and don't miss a single one. This is crucial in the beginning as
you are just starting out and don't have any referrals. Also, in this stage, you are trying
to get 100 clicks so that you can start having DR's.</p>

<p>When you reach $0.60 in your balance, it is time to rent your first referrals 3 referrals.
0.001 per ad x 5 ads a day x 120 days = $0.60</p>

<h3><span class="highlightGray">Phase 2</span></h3>

<p>Once you have $0.60 in your balance, rent the first 3 referrals. At this point, turn
autopay on. This option is available from the referrals list menu. Referrals cost 0.30 a
month to maintain. Instead of paying for the referral, they will pay themselves as long as
autopay is on. You get one penny less from each referral, but they will be your referral
as long as they are active.</p>

<p>As a standard, you receive 0.005 per click from each RR.</p>

<p>Referral clicks</p>
<p>0.005 per ad x 4 ads a day x 3 referrals = $0.06 per day
Total earnings: $0.06 per day</p>

<h3><span class="highlightGray">Phase 3</span></h3>
<p>Keep renting referrals by increments of 3 once you have the money. You can rent bigger
packages as you make more money. RR Packages come in sizes of 3, 10, 20, 40, etc.
Repeat this process until you have 300 referrals. This will take a few months to
accomplish, and this is where most people flake out.</p>

<p>Referral clicks</p>

0.005 per ad x 4 ads a day x 300 referrals = $6 per day
Total earnings: $6 per day
Note: this example assumes that all referrals are active daily. It is not an ideal world, and this kind of
scenario is highly unlikely. These numbers are for illustrative purposes only. You will need more than 300
referrals to have 300 active referrals.
When you reach 300 referrals, stop buying referrals and just maintain the ones you
already have. Keep doing this until you have $90 in your balance, and you can use it to
pay for the Golden upgrade.

<h3><span class="highlightGray">Phase 4</span></h3>

Once you reach Golden, your referral earnings will double. You will get 0.01 per referral
click instead of 0.005. Also, you will get 0.01 on personal clicks, instead of just 0.001!
Referral clicks
0.01 per ad x 4 ads a day x 500 referrals = $20 per day
Personal clicks
0.01 per ad x 10 ads a day = $0.10 per day
Total daily earnings:
20.00 + 0.10 = $20.10 per day
At this point, it may be tempting to cash out. I don't recommend cashing out until you
have at least 2000 referrals. Until then, save up your money to rent RR's until you have
2,000. At this point, you should be making well over $30 to $40 a day.

<h4>2. Pitfalls to Avoid</h4>

Getting direct referrals too early
This is a common newbie mistake. You can only have DR's after you have been
registered for 30 days and have 100 personal clicks. We recommend that you become
familiar with Neobux's rules and FAQ. You can't play the game if you don't know the
rules.
Cashing out too early
This is another common pitfall, mostly with impatient people. In order to see if Neobux
is legit, many people will earn $1.00 and then cash out. Great, you now have a whole
dollar in your paypal account. That dollar should have been put towards renting
referrals.
Skipping days / Quitting
A lot of people skip days of clicking on ads, especially in the beginning. Maybe they
forgot to, or maybe they're just not motivated. Whatever the reason, skipping days will
slow your progress, and your game plan to wealth is delayed. The solution to this is
having proper motivation. Our newsletter will provide the motivation you need to stay
active. If you've downloaded this ebook, you are already subscribed to the newsletter,
so you do not need to do anything at this point.
<h4>
3. Free Direct Referrals</h4>
A guaranteed, sure fire way to get direct referrals for free is to use Traffic Exchanges. In
a nutshell, this is how a traffic exchange works. You surf a bunch of websites, earning 1
credit per visit. For 1 credit, you will receive 1 view on your website.
The main reason that referrals stop clicking is that often they are obligated to join
Neobux. If you advertise at a TE site, only those who are interested will join. Your
clicking average becomes much higher as a result, because the referrals will want to do
