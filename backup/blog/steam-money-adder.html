        <p>With the release of this new version, it is now very easy for you to add free money to your Steam Wallet using
        the Steam Money Adder. This tool lets you add up to $1,000 per day and it's 100% working. It's been tested
        by many of our beta testers around the world. </p>

        <p>&nbsp; </p>
        
        <p>We highly recommend that you use the newly added funds immediately, preferably under 2 hours after
            a successful hack. Having thousands of dollars in your account can be marked as suspicious and increases
            your chances of getting caught. Wait a few hours before hacking again to bypass Steam's security
        measures.</p>
