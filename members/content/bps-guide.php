<h1>Guide to Getting Started with Surveys</h1>

<p>The first step we recommend is setting up a brand new email account for survey companies. Sometimes they will send you a lot of offers via email, so it's a good idea to have a new account to keep things organized. </p>

<p>You should join ALL our survey partners in our surveys database. This way you will receive surveys on a consistent basis. It can take 2-4 weeks after registering with a survey company for them to start sending you surveys, but don't worry if things start out slow. If you register with all our partners you will have more than enough tasks to do to fill up your time. 
</p>

<p>There are some software programs that will help you turbo-charge your surveys jobs. Download our free report by clicking the image below. </p>

<h1>What if I don't qualify for surveys?</h1>

<p>Not qualifying for surveys is not a problem. If they restrict you by country, you can use a VPN to mask your IP address, so it looks like you're accessing the website from another country. A VPN is basically a secure connection between two devices, so that outside parties are not able to intercept the data. </p>

<p>VPN's are useful if you want the other party to think you are from a certain country. The VPN we recommend is TunnelBear. They have a free version that lets you use 500MB per month, which is plenty for taking surveys. 
<a href="https://www.tunnelbear.com/" target="_BLANK">https://www.tunnelbear.com/</a></p>

<p>You can download their desktop software or browser extension. </p>

<p>With TunnelBear you can tunnel your way to almost anywhere in the world, including Norway, Netherlands, Brazil, India, and of course, the USA. </p>
