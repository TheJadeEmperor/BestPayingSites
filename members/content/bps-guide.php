<h1>Guide to Getting Started with Surveys</h1>

<p>The first step we recommend is setting up a brand new email account for survey companies. Sometimes they will send you a lot of offers via email, so it's a good idea to have a new account to keep things organized. </p>

<p>You should join ALL our survey partners in our surveys database. This way you will receive surveys on a consistent basis. It can take 2-4 weeks after registering with a survey company for them to start sending you surveys, but don't worry if things start out slow. If you register with all our partners you will have more than enough tasks to do to fill up your time. </p>

<p>There are some software programs that will help you turbo-charge your surveys jobs. Download our free report by clicking the image below. </p>

<h1>What if I don't qualify for surveys?</h1>

<h2>Mask Your IP Address</h2>

<p>Not qualifying for surveys is not a problem. If they restrict you by country, you can use a VPN to mask your IP address, so it looks like you're accessing the website from another country. A VPN is basically a secure connection between two devices, so that outside parties are not able to intercept the data. </p>

<p>VPN's are useful if you want the other party to think you are from a certain country. The VPN we recommend is TunnelBear. They have a free version that lets you use 500MB per month, which is plenty for taking surveys. 
<a href="https://www.tunnelbear.com/" target="_BLANK">https://www.tunnelbear.com/</a></p>

<p>You can download their desktop software or browser extension. </p>

<p>With TunnelBear you can tunnel your way to almost anywhere in the world, including Norway, Netherlands, Brazil, India, and of course, the USA. </p>


<h2>Create A Fake Identity</h2>

<p>If you pretend to be from another country, you need an address that matches your country. There's something called fake address generator that can be accessed here: </p>

<p><a href="https://www.fakeaddressgenerator.com/" target="_BLANK">https://www.fakeaddressgenerator.com/</a></p>

<p>They have almost all countries available. You should use the VPN to pretend to be a certain country and find a fake address that matches that country. This will create the illusion of a fake identity. Since you cannot receive checks from a fake address, you have only one payment option which is Paypal. </p>

<p>Many surveys require you to enter a phone number, so the next thing you need to do is create a fake phone number. All you need is a google voice number. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/voice#inbox" target="_BLANK">https://www.google.com/voice#inbox</a></p>

<p>To get a new phone # you must first connect your real phone #. Google will send you a verification code for one time use. Then your phone will be connected to the google voice #. After this step you can use google voice to verify your phone # for surveys. </p>
