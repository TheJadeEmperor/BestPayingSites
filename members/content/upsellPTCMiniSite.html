<p><b>Dear PTC User,</b></p>

<p>If you are like thousands of others, you have probably tried to make your own website, but with no success.
You've probably tried blogger, weebly, and maybe google websites, and some other free services.
And you find out that <i>you get what you paid for</i> - complicated and messy editors, unclear instructions, and ultimately, <u>the result is <b>not</b> what you want</u>.  </p>

<p>A free service is better than nothing, right? But you have no control over the design, the content,
and overall feel of the website. Seriously, if you do not like your own website, how do you think your
visitors will feel? And if they don't like the website, why would they join as your referral? </p>

<p>Presentation is everything - your site needs to be clean and professional to lure people to joining your PTC's.
I have seen a lot of "ugly" looking websites, and I am surprised that people are actually promoting them.
If I were them I would just shut it down and start from scratch...</p>

<p><i>Your website could be losing referrals right now as we speak</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Even if you want to have a website...</h2>

<p>You have to pay for web hosting fees, don't you? And on top of that, someone has to design it for you,
and that costs money too. Probably more than you can afford. Most sites costs anywhere between $400 to $500 dollars, even for a simple design. For more advanced designs, the site can cost an arm and a leg.</p>

<p>For a PTC user, that is out of your budget - so you have to settle for the free service - and I already went over why they don't work. </p>


<h2>Introducing PTC Mini-Sites</h2>

<p>Just imagine...</p>

<p>A single page that allows you to <i>promote all your sites</i> with just one link...</p>

<p>A mini-site service that lists all your favorite websites, customized specifically for YOUR needs</p>

<p>A website with up to 10 pages, that has everything you want on it - Facebook apps, widgets, payment proofs,
rotating banners, etc. </p>
