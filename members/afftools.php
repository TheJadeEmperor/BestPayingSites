<textarea name=s1 rows=18 cols=70>Want to Make $20 to $30 a Day from PTC Websites? 

(date)

Hi fellow PTC User, 

Wouldn't it be nice to make a bundle of money quickly, with minimal effort, working at home in your pajamas? 

Of course it would. I, for one, would love to have money flowing into my bank account, working only a few hours a week from home, so I'd have more time to spend with my family and loved ones, without a boss looking over my shoulder. 

But the reality of internet business is not all flowers and roses. As the internet grows in numbers, so do the number of scams. Making money online seems to be getting harder and harder these days, isn't it? 

As you may already know, PTC stands for "pay to click" websites. These are sites that pay you a little bit of money in exchange for viewing advertisements. You can sign up for free and make money without any experience or technical knowledge. 

It's so simple anyone can do it. However, that's where the downfall is. Because it seems so easy, millions have fallen prey to scams that were promising big money and failing to deliver. 

Over the course of my career, I have been scammed many times. Looking back I can't believe how stupid I was. I joined sites that pay 0.01 per click, and I clicked every day diligently, waiting for my $5.00 cashout. 

But once a PTC goes scam, you will never see your hard earned money.

Often times I found myself working for nothing. I couldn't even get the little amount of money that they owe me, the money I worked hard for.

But fear not, there's a positive side to this. Some sites are legit and have been paying for years. And they are not hard to find. 

However, even if you know which sites to join, you a plan of action to succeed. Without a strategy, you may as well be shooting blindly. 

With the right strategy, you can aim straight at the bullseye and hit your target every time. 


I know how hard it is to survive in the PTC World, especially as a newbie. Without a proper plan of action, things can get real muddy. 

I don't want you to make the same mistakes I did. Learn from my mistakes and benefit from my many years of experience.
