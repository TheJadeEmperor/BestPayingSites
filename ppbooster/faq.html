<p id="noPaypal">&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Paypal is not accepted in my country! What should I do?</b></p>

<p>Fear not. You can still make sales without using Paypal. You can use Payspree, an online merchant service that handles your sales and product delivery for you.</p> 

<p>To sign up for a FREE account at Payspree, go to: <br />
    <a href='http://payspree.com/r/63991' target='_blank'>http://payspree.com/r/63991</a>
</p>

<p>Payspree accepts payment processors like Paypal, Payza, and Moneybookers. So even if your country doesn't accept Paypal you can still receive money from using Payspree.</p>



<p id="noMoney">&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>I can't afford the Paypal Booster, can you help me? <br />
        I don't have money in my Paypal Account, can you help me?</b></p>

<p>I understand your pain, it's tough not having money. It's a good thing I'm a patient person. I will wait for you to get the funds in your account so you can get the $7 to get the Paypal Booster. Until then, please don't bother me with requests to get it for free. Your time is valuable and so is mine, so let's not waste it. </p>

<p id="refundPolicy">&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Do you have a refund policy?</b></p>

<p>Our refund policy is the following: use the system for 30 days and if you don't make any money with it, we will refund your purchase price.</p>

<p>We will refund your money, once the following criteria are met: </p>

<ul>
    <li>30 days has passed </li>
    <li>The method has been used </li>
    <li>No money has been made using the method</li>
</ul>


<p>So when requesting a refund, please confirm that you have met the above criteria. But hopefully, youâ€™re not one of those above mentioned people. You want to use the strategy and do the work and get paid for your efforts.

<p id="changePrice">&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Can I change the price of the Paypal Booster?</b></p>

<p>Yes, you absolutely can change the price to whatever you want. If you have the Paypal Booster, you own the rights to it, and can sell it (or even give it away as a free gift). It's up to you what you do with it. 
</p>



<p id="paypalButton">&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>I cannot find Paypal button in the HTML file.</b></p>

<p>Please read the PDF guide that was delivered to you upon purchase to find out how to set up your Paypal button, so you can get paid by your customers. 
In the HTML file that you downloaded, you have to find the following:
</p>

<textarea cols="75" rows="18"><!-- Paypal Button Code -->           
<form action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" method="post" id="paymentform">
<input type="hidden" name="cmd" value="_xclick">

</form>			
<!-- Paypal Button Code --></textarea>

<p>This is where all the information is being sent to Paypal.
    Then you find this line: </p>

<p><b>your-paypal-account@email.com</b></p>

<p>Replace this text with Your Paypal Address. This tells Paypal that your customers are paying you. This is extremely important that you do this step right.
</p>


<p id="blogURL">&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>To create a new blog, it requires me to enter a blog address. What should I put in? </b></p>

<p>You can put in something related to the Paypal Booster or related to making money. For example:
</p>

<p>
paypal-booster-money.blogspot.com<br />
make-money-system.blogspot.com<br />
paypal-booster-2014.blogspot.com<br />
</p>

<p>You can get creative with the name of your blog. Just make sure it is available and not already taken by someone else.</p>



<p id="whereToAdvertise">&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Where do I advertise Paypal Booster?</b></p>

<p>As mentioned in the system, you can advertise the Paypal Booster at any PTC site. I recommend you advertise at sites that have a lot of members and an established history <br />
Ex: Neobux, Clixsense, Probux, Wordlinx, Adhitz</p>



<p id="promoteURL">&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Which link do I promote in PTC Sites?</b></p>

<p>You have to promote your Blog's link on the different PTC sites mentioned in the system, which is 
xxx.blogspot.com</p>



<p id="blogSpam">&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>Help! My Blog was marked as spam, what should I do?</b></p>

<p>If your blog is marked as spam, you can do the following to avoid blogger's spam detectors.</p>

<p>(1) Firstly, try to change a few of the words on the sales page. You can do this easily by editing the HTML code in your blog editor.</p>

<p>(2) Try making a new blogger account so that the spam detectors can't trace your new account to your old one. Before you do this, you should clear your cache, your cookies, and your internet history. Make a new gmail account and use that gmail to create a new blogger. </p>

<p>(3) Make a new blogger account on another browser, one that you usually do not use. For example, if you used Chrome, use Firefox instead. This way, Blogger will not be able to track your old data. </p>



<p id="handleRefunds">&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Once I setup my Paypal Booster system, how do I handle refund requests?</b></p> 

<p>If it happens that one of your customers wants a refund, it is up to you how to handle it. Once you set up the system, you own the system, and the customers are your customers. You can customize the sales page however you want as the owner. </p>
