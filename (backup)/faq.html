<h2>How Does the Sales Process Work?</h2>

<p align="left">The customer orders from the sales page<br>
They are taken to paypal, then they login and make the payment<br>
There is a small link that says "Return to Merchant", they need to click the link to return<br>
to the website to download the eBook<br>
In addition, our system will send them an email with their download details</p>
<p align="left">All this is done automatically through a script called Rapid Action Profits, the script
that allows us to run this entire process.</p>

<h3>Help, My Customer Did Not Receive The Download</h3>
<p>After the customer orders from paypal, there is a small link that says "Return to Merchant", however,
the link is too small and many people overlook this. And there are times that, for whatever reason,
they do not receive the download email.</p>

<p>Our email servers may have been down during the time. We use hostmonster.com and they have a 99%
uptime, however, there is still a 1% chance that the servers may be down. Another reason
they do not receive the download email is probably because we are marked as spam. They
need to add admin@bestpayingsites.com to their safelist.</p>

<p>If this happens, all you have to do is email the customer their download link:
<a href="http://bestpayingsites.com/neobux/?action=download&id=transactionID">
http://bestpayingsites.com/neobux/?action=download&id=<b>transactionID</b></a></p>

<p>Replace transaction ID with the paypal transaction ID.</p>

<h3>Help, My Customer Wants a Refund!</h3>
<p>Don't panic. Situations like these happen when you do any kind of business. Most likely it is because
they did not receive their ebook download. If that is the case, just send them their download link.</p>

<p>If they are not happy with the contents of the eBook, then that is another story. We made the ebook
based on our knowledge and experiences of the PTC world, and we also gathered strategies from other
ebooks we have bought. We strive to be the best Neobux / PTC ebook, but we will not please everybody.</p>

<h3>The Download Link Expired</h3>
<img src="<?=$mDir?>expired.jpg" border="1" class="clickable">

<p>From the time of purchase, customers have <?=$sys_expire?> hours to download the eBook. If their link
has expired and they still want to download it, the contact us, and we will add another <?=$sys_expire?> hours
to their expiration date. The script does this to prevent hackers and cheaters from downloading
the eBook for free.</p>

<h3>Invalid Download Link?</h3>
<p>If a customer receives a refund from paypal, then their download link will no longer work. The script
does this to prevent hackers and cheaters from downloading the eBook for free. When this happens,
ask the customer to cancel the refund, and we will re-activate their download for them.</p>

<h3>Will This Really Make Me Money?</h3>
<p>We understand that you are skeptical. We have made a lot of money selling the ebook, and if we
can do it, so can you. Don't believe us? See the screenshots below: </p>

<p>Count how many $7.00 transactions we've had since February, which is the inception of this
website. As an affiliate of <?=$sys_item_name?>, you too can fatten your bank account by selling our
ebooks. </p>
